# monadics
monadic structures implemented with Java 17

This project aims to implement functional structures such as Optional and Result (aka Scala's `Try` or Haskell's `Maybe`) using Java 17's sealed classes.

It is not in a state where it can be used as a library, but my aim is to work on it until it gets there.
